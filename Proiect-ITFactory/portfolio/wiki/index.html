                        The <strong>horse</strong><em>(Equus caballus)</em> is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. 
                        It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
                        The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, 
                        close to Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses
                        around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses 
                        in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild 
                        as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are horses that never have 
                        been domesticated and historically linked to the megafauna category of species. There is an extensive,
                        specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages,
                        size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

                        Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.
                        Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy",
                        a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony, 
                        died in 2007 at age 56.

                        Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere
                        and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere.The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.
                        The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:

                <p tabindex="0">
                    The height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy,
                    unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.
                    n English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to 4 inches (101.6 mm). The height is expressed as the number of full hands, 
                    followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation "h" or "hh" (for "hands high"). Thus, a horse described as "15.2 h" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, 
                    for a total of 62 inches (157.5 cm) in height.

                    Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BCE. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse 
                    was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second 
                    source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.

                The concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times.
                Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called "thoroughbreds". Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse 
                (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry. Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted
                consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods.

                    Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. 
                    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas,
                    13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone. 
                    The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect 
                    spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.

                <p tabindex="0">
                    Horses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BCE,
                    and the use of horses in warfare was widespread by the end of the Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, 
                    horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective.
                    Horses have been used in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.
